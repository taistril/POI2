			one of the most complete and best preserved castles in England.</p>
			<p>What you are viewing is the Gateway added in the 17th Century and is decorative rather than defensive.

			<p>During bull-baiting, trained dogs would attempt to flatten themselves to the ground, 
			creeping as close to the bull as possible, then darting out and attempting to bite the bull in the nose or head area. 
			The bull would be tethered by a collar and rope, which was staked into the ground. 
			As a dog darted at the bull, the bull would attempt to catch the dog with his head and horns and throw it into the air.</p>

			They lead to rows of small cottages crammed into the town as the only solution to a need for houses, as the owners 
			of the land around the town (The Earls of Thanet) refused to allow development beyond the town itself at the time.</p>
			<p>Luckily, the narrowness of the ginnels also protected the cottages from straying cows from the cattle market
